# Overview

This guide explains how to create your first flag in LaunchDarkly and use
it to control how that feature is released to users. Feature management starts with flags. Feature flags wrap your code and give you
the ability to release your feature in a safe and controlled way.

In this guide, you will use Glitch to complete the process of creating a flag in LaunchDarkly,
including configuring your environment and SDKs, and creating the flag itself.

You will:
- Clone a sample web app
- Add the LaunchDarkly SDK to the web app
- Create and use your first LaunchDarkly feature flag
- Turn on your first feature

# Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have the following prerequisites:

* An active LaunchDarkly account with the ability to create a flag.
* Basic knowledge of the Python and Javascript programming languages. You need these to complete the exercises in this guide.
* Access to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

# Concepts

Read this section to understand the way we use some terms in this guide.

## LaunchDarkly data hierarchy

The basic unit of work in LaunchDarkly is a **feature flag**, often referred to as a **flag**. Flags exist inside LaunchDarkly **environments**, and exist across multiple environments. All the environments in your LaunchDarkly instance are referred to as your LaunchDarkly **project**. A project can contain multiple environments.

Typically, most software projects have a test, staging, and production environment. In LaunchDarkly, you can define any environment structure that suits your
team’s needs.

For example, your mobile team might need an `android test`,
`android prod`, `ios test`, and `ios prod` environment in the "Mobile apps" project.

To learn more, read [Projects](/home/organize/projects) and [Environments](/home/organize/environments).

## LaunchDarkly SDK basics

The LaunchDarkly SDK is the primary tool you use to manage feature
flags in your application code. The SDK is responsible for making the connection
to LaunchDarkly and giving your app access to the flags defined in your
environment.

After you implement the client SDK in your application code, your code can fetch a flag from LaunchDarkly and evaluate it locally to get the flag’s value
for a given user or context.

To learn more, read [Getting started with SDKs](/sdk).

LaunchDarkly's SDK comes in a variety of client-side, server-side, and mobile
implementations for different languages. This guide uses the Python SDK for our server-side code.

There are several differences between the server and client-side SDKs. Client-side SDKs are designed to run on a single-user
desktop, embedded application, client-side web application, or on mobile devices.

Server-side SDKs are designed for multi-user systems and services running on
a corporate network or in the cloud. Because they are designed to exist in more secure environments, and not rely on mobile data to make connections to LaunchDarkly, server-side SDKs retrieve the entire set of flag rules and evaluate the flag values for each user or context within the SDK's runtime.

Client-side SDKs receive the evaluated value of a flag for the user on the chosen application directly from LaunchDarkly. We assume that client-side SDKs are on devices that may be shared or less secure, so LaunchDarkly never transmits flag rules to client-side SDKs.

To learn more, read [Understanding the different types of SDKs](/sdk/concepts/client-side-server-side#understanding-the-different-types-of-sdks).

## Using feature flags with variations

With LaunchDarkly's feature flags, you can develop a feature, wrap it in a feature flag, and prevent users from accessing it until you want them to. When you wrap a feature in a feature flag, you're  gating access to the feature based on a condition you specify.

You can also specify multiple variations of a flag to produce different outcomes. For example, you could create three variations of the same flag, each of which shows a price page with a 10%, 15%, or 25% discount.

The simplest feature flags have two variations: `true` and `false`. These are called `boolean` flags. This is the kind of flag we'll use in the exercise below.

An example of a feature flag wrapped around a feature is depicted below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Example code: feature wrapped in a flag', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
if enableFeature(on.click.checkout, {...}) then
  /* show the new feature */
else
  /* show the old feature */
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `ld_client` has a few methods that allow your code to decide which variation of a feature to show.

An example of a variation method is depicted below:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'Variation method', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
# flag-key: String
# user: Python dictionary
# default-variation: boolean, string, or dictionary
ld_client.variation(<FLAG-KEY>, <USER>, <DEFAULT-VARIATION>)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `user` property in the second parameter of the `variation()` method is an object that describes the user against which you want to evaluate that flag.

LaunchDarkly keeps track of this user and remembers what variation they received so your app can show them the same feature each time they visit. This also gives you knowledge about
your users so you can target specific users with your new feature.

The third property, `default-variation`, is the value that the flag defaults to if `ldclient` encounters an error. For example, if the feature flag key doesn't
exist or the user doesn't have a key specified, LaunchDarkly returns the default flag variation.

# Exercise: Using the LaunchDarkly SDK

In this exercise, we'll implement a pricing page on a mock online store. You will introduce a new pricing tier, wrap the code for it in a feature flag, and
release it to users by enabling the flag.

This exercise uses a Python-based web application we provide and runs on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about), an online tool for creating web apps.

## Remixing the lab app

You must remix the Glitch project embedded below to create an editable copy of the Python web app. **Remixing** is Glitch's term for cloning a project. This creates an editable copy of the Python web app we use for this exercise.

[Click this link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/ld-space-camp-0) to remix the app, or follow the instructions below.

<iframe src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/ld-space-camp-0?path=README.md&previewSize=0&attributionHidden=true" title="ld-space-camp-0 on Glitch" allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media" width="100%" height="420px"></iframe>

1. Click the fullscreen button in the bottom right-hand corner of the Glitch app embedded above.
app. The app opens in a separate tab.
2. In the new Glitch tab, click **Remix to Edit**.
3. The name of your project appears in the top left corner. If you want to rename the app, click the arrow next to the name.

### Switching between the code and app views in Glitch

In the Glitch app, you have the option to see the live app in production, or the code for the app.

To switch between them:

1. Navigate to the Glitch app you remixed.
2. At the top of the Glitch page, click **Show**:

![The "Show" menu in Glitch.](glitch-show-menu.png)

3. Confirm that you can switch between the code and the app view.

## Setting up your LaunchDarkly project and environment

You must set up a LaunchDarkly project and environment where your flags will live. Create a new project or use an existing one in your account.

To create a new project:

1. Navigate to the [Account settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) page.
2. Click **+ Project**.
3. Give your project a human-readable **Name**. In the example below, our project is called `Test`.
4. Click **Save**.
5. In the **Account Settings** page, click to copy the new project's SDK key to your clipboard.

![The Account Settings page in LaunchDarkly with environment SDK keys called out.](../../../images/space-camp-projects.png)

## Configuring the LaunchDarkly SDK key in your app

Glitch lets you store environment variables, such as secrets or config variables, that your app can read from memory. This is a more secure practice than
hard-coding these directly into your code.

To learn more about environment variables in Glitch, read [Glitch's documentation](https://glitch.com/help/env/).

1. Click the `.env` file in the Glitch sidebar.
2. Assign the **SDK key** you copied above to an environment variable called `LD_SDK_KEY`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="env"
  values={[
    { label: '.env', value: 'env', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="env">

```env
LD_SDK_KEY=<PASTE-YOUR-SDK-KEY-HERE>
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>


![The .env file in Glitch.](../../../images/dot-env.png)

## Installing the Python SDK in your code

Now you must install the LaunchDarkly Python SDK in your Python code. To do this, add the LaunchDarkly Python SDK as a dependency to the Python app by adding the following line to the `requirements` file.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'requirements', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
launchdarkly-server-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The `requirements` file defines all of the Python modules the app you're building depends on.

This app is configured to install dependencies and restart when certain of its files change. You do not need to refresh or reinstall anything.

To verify a successful installation, open the the log console in Glitch:

1. Click **Tools** in the bottom left hand corner.
2. Select **Logs**.

If you configured the Python SDK correctly, you will see a message indicating that `launchdarkly-server-sdk` was installed.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVmHqHSDnNBXkZgd2jIXx1Hq9B7eAFgA/preview" width="100%" height="410" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Initializing the LaunchDarkly client

After you install the SDK, you can import the LaunchDarkly client into your code and initialize it.

To do this:

1. Add the following line to the top of your `server.py` file:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'server.py', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
import ldclient
...
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

2. Specify your SDK key to connect the SDK to LaunchDarkly.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'server.py', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
...
# Paste your SDK key inside the `.env` file. Don't paste it
# here or you'll expose your SDK key to anyone who opens
# this app. Instead, use the environment variable to
# reference the SDK key, as shown in the example below:
ldclient.set_sdk_key(os.getenv('LD_SDK_KEY'))

# We will use this client from now on:
ld_client = ldclient.get()
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

You've initialized the `ldclient`. Next, use the client to wrap your app's new pricing tier inside a flag.

## Creating a new flag

Before you add code to the pricing page, create a new flag in your project. Name the flag `pricing-tier-3`.

Here's how to create the new flag:

1. From the LaunchDarkly app, click **Feature flags**.
2. Click **+ Flag**.
3. Enter `pricing-tier-3` for the name.
4. Optionally, add a description of the flag.
5. Leave the flag variation set to **Boolean**.
6. Save the new flag.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AWHYtS_Fzdm1nBu7zKRWx6js8QAUEB9n/preview" width="100%" height="360" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The flag's targeting state is set to `off` by default. You can turn it on after implementing the code to use it.

The new flag is pictured below:

![pricing-tier-3 flag](../../images/pricing-tier-3-flag.png)

## Adding a new pricing tier

You're now ready to add the new pricing tier to the pricing page. To do this, you'll add the HTML for the new page to your app, but only after wrapping it in a feature flag so only intended users can see it.

The updated pricing tier page is pictured below:

![The new pricing tier.](../../../images/space-camp-pricing-page-1.png)

It uses the following HTML:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'views/tier_3.html', value: 'html', },
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
<!-- Admiral Tier -->
<div class="card h-100">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title text-center">
      Admiral Class
    </h5>
    <h6 class="card-price text-center">
      <i class="fab fa-btc"></i> 250,000
    </h6>
    <hr />
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li>
        <span class="fa-li"><i
            class="fas fa-space-shuttle"></i></span>Shuttle-class
        x701 space coach
      </li>

...

      <li>
        <span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-grav"></i></span>Space walk experience
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="card-footer">
    <a id="tier3" href="#"
      class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Select class</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

This HTML is also available in your Glitch app, in **views/** > `tier_3.html`.

## Wrapping the pricing page code in a flag

Now you wrap the HTML for the new pricing page in a flag. This prevents anyone who is not targeted by the flag from seeing the new pricing page.

Use the following `server.py` code:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'server.py', value: 'py', }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
@app.route('/')
def pricing():
    """Displays the pricing page."""

    # Implement the feature flag here
    return render_template('pricing.html')

```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The code above shows the controller handler for the pricing page route to the
web app. All this handler does is return the rendered `pricing.html` template
to the user.

The following code sample shows an instruction to evaluate the flag, then pass the result of the evaluated flag
into the page template.

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="py"
  values={[
    { label: 'server.py', value: 'py', }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="py">

```py
@app.route('/')
def pricing():
    """Displays the pricing page."""

    # Since this page doesn't require a logged in user,
    # tell LaunchDarkly that this is an anonymous user.
    user = {
      "key": "anon",
      "anonymous": True
    }
    is_tier_3_enabled = ld_client.variation('pricing-tier-3', user, False)
    return render_template('pricing.html', is_tier_3_enabled=is_tier_3_enabled)
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The controller passes the evaluated flag value to the template named `is_tier_3_enabled`.

Now update the `pricing.html` template to determine if the new pricing tier should be displayed.

The updated template should look like this:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="html"
  values={[
    { label: 'views/pricing.html', value: 'html', }
  ]
}>

<CodeTabItem value="html">

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block main %}
<section class="pricing py-5">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="card-group">

        {% include "tier_1.html" %}
        {% include "tier_2.html" %}

        {# Tier 3 is now controlled by a feature flag! #}
        {% if is_tier_3_enabled == True %}
          {% include "tier_3.html" %}
        {% endif %}

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
{% endblock %}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you've implemented the changes above, refresh the browser with your Glitch app in it.

Verify that the new tier is not enabled. The pricing page should not show the new pricing option yet.

## Turning your feature on

Now that you've wrapped your feature in a flag, it's time to turn your feature on. This will make the new pricing option appear in your app.

To do this, return to the LaunchDarkly app.

1. Navigate to the `pricing-tier-3` flag.
2. Click the Targeting toggle to toggle the flag to *on*.
3. Enter a comment.
4. Click **Turn on**.
5. Refresh the browser with your Glitch app in it again to verify that the new pricing tier is available.
